# M7 Strategy Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Ticket Overview

**Milestone**: M7 - Strategy enhancements (multi-timeframe, shorts/futures, exits, sizing)

**Scope**:
- Multi-timeframe confirmation: execute on 30m with 1h/4h trend filter; alignment utilities
- Additional exits: time-based stop, partial take-profit (scales), slope reversal confirm
- Dynamic position sizing: volatility target (ATR/sigma), max risk per trade; pyramiding optional
- Optional: add short/futures mode (spot-only by default); fees/slippage per venue
- Tests: rule correctness and interplay, parameterization

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All features have been implemented, tested, and documented.

- **Slope reversal**: Exit when trend slope reverses
- **Combination**: OR multiple conditions together

#### ✅ Dynamic Position Sizing

## Configuration Examples

### Multi-Timeframe with Dynamic Sizing

config = BacktestConfig(
    initial_capital=10000.0,
    sizing_mode="volatility",
    volatility_target=0.02,
    max_risk_per_trade=0.02,
    max_bars_held=100,
)
```

### With Partial Take-Profit
```python
config = BacktestConfig(
    enable_partial_tp=True,
    partial_tp_scales=[
        (0.02, 0.5),  # Take 50% at +2%
        (0.05, 0.3),  # Take 30% at +5%
        (0.10, 0.2),  # Take 20% at +10%
    ],
)
```
